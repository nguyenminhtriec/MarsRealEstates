# MarsPhotos
This Android app is an extension of Google's basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-mars-photos-starter app.
Main functions are:
1. Getting Mars photos from the internet by Retrofit and Web service (retrieve 838 photos)
2. Showing the photos on device screen (allow filtering the photos by type: Buy/Rent/All, using a menu on TopAppBar)
3. Clicking a photo on HomeScreen navigates to Detail Screen with more information of selected photo.
4. The app uses MutableState to handle UI states. (StateFlow is not apply for this purpose)
